# Smart Contract Hacking Challenges

This section is dedicated to smart contract hacking challenges, where you will have the opportunity to sharpen your skills in identifying vulnerabilities and exploiting them. Each exercise within this folder focuses on a specific hacking technique, enabling you to gain practical experience in smart contract security.

## Exercise Structure

In each exercise folder, you will find a smart contract that presents a vulnerability. The contract also includes comments within the code to help you understand the purpose of the contract and its functions. It is essential to read and analyze these comments as they provide valuable insights into the contract's vulnerabilities.

Please note that while each exercise focuses on a specific vulnerability, it is possible for a contract to have multiple vulnerabilities. Your objective is to identify and exploit the primary vulnerability described in the exercise. However, it is encouraged to report any additional vulnerabilities you discover during your analysis. 

## Important Considerations
Please note the following important considerations:

- The challenges and exercises provided in this repository are intended for educational purposes only. They are designed to help you gain practical experience in smart contract security.

- **Do not use these contracts or derive inspiration from them to create code for production environments**. The contracts provided may contain deliberate vulnerabilities for learning purposes and should not be used in any real-world applications.

- It is crucial to always follow ethical guidelines when interacting with live contracts on the Ethereum network. Never use these techniques for malicious purposes or without the explicit consent of contract owners.

<i><b>Note:</b> If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to the repository maintainer. However, we kindly request that you refrain from publishing the solution publicly, including in issues or pull requests. Instead, we encourage you to directly contact the repository maintainer for further discussion.</i>
